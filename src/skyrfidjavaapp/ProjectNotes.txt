Problems
Unsatisfied Link Error. Cannot load umf.dll. SO 30767478 says that the dll must be in SysWOW64 folder
when running a 32-bit JRE on a 64-bit computer. (I think this is the explanation.)
Previous versions have used other workarounds, such as putting the dll in the root directory, which
did not work in this application for an unknown reason.
