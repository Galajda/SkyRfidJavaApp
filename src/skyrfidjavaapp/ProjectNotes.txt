TODO:
Theft bit uses AFI byte. On = 07. Off = 00.
Add Settings pane to change defaults and advanced properties.
    Add extra keystrokes element to xml.
    Add read frequency element. How often does reader check for tag in field?
Read pane:
    Open port in constructor. Loop to read repeatedly. Close port when exit.
