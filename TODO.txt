App title:
    Concatenate app title with name of current configuration 
AppState:
    Why do I use ISO-8859-1 encoding of xml instead of utf-8?
    Add functions for new state elements
    Is it good practice to exit application in case of error in constructor?
    getConfig what if input string is null?
    Constructor: move error messages to constants
    Remove all getters and setters, make getSettingsValue and setSettingsValue public? 
        The advantage of the individual accessors is that one knows when one has covered 
        all of the parameters by cycling through all the functions. This makes writing code
        more reliable. See for example SettingsPane btnSaveConfig_Click.
        
Toggle single multi pane:
    If app state is write, do not allow multiple mode.

Write pane:
    Communicate errors to user: no device, no tag, bad input
    Validate input before writing
    
Read pane:    
    If detect multiple tags in single mode, throw error.
TagActor:
    Move uid to parent?
    
TheftBitWorker:
    replace on/off enum with the new value
    delete the whole thing.

Settings pane:    
    Show and hide buttons to guide user to proper operation. zB do not allow use config before saving. 
        Or save automatically? Cancel instead of delete new config?
    Use extra keystrokes element. Send extra keystrokes with barcode. Allow
	multiple entries, such as one KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program x is the active window,
	two KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program y is the active window.
    Adjust padding of panes for better fit
    Always show close button

AppConstants:
    
AppSettingsEnum:
    delete. string constants suffice.

DataValidation:
    Check length in the reg ex pattern.    

Config names xml and dtd:
    delete

RoboTypist:
    recognize escape chars like \n \l from extra keys

dll functions
    does stay quiet state persist after tag leaves field? rf.exe can call stay quiet 
        and reset to ready. when stay quiet tag leaves field and is 
        reintroduced, it is ready
    how does multi read work? 

Sending keystrokes via Robot. Notify user if platform does not allow robot constructor or input control.
	Catch errors related to existence of user32.dll.
	Customize extra keystrokes according to the active window.
Make jQuery for XML.
Move FxMsgBox to MyJavaUtils package

Harmonize names app state, configuration, settings among file name, constant name, variable name

Test barcodes that contain letters
