Add Settings pane to change defaults and advanced properties.
    Add extra keystrokes element to xml. Send extra keystrokes with barcode. Allow
	multiple entries, such as one KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program x is the active window,
	two KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program y is the active window.
    Add read frequency element. How often does reader check for tag in field?
    Add more configurations. Allow user to choose a config, rather than individual 
    parameters.
    Move anti theft values to settings, rather than hard-coded

App title:
    Show name of current configuration
AppState:
    Why do I use ISO-8859-1 encoding of xml instead of utf-8?
    Add functions for new state elements
    Is it good practice to exit application in case of error in constructor?
    getConfig what if input string is null?
    Constructor: move error messages to constants
    Remove all getters and setters, make getSettingsValue and setSettingsValue public? 
        The advantage of the individual accessors is that one knows when one has covered 
        all of the parameters by cycling through all the functions. This makes writing code
        more reliable. See for example SettingsPane btnSaveConfig_Click.
    
    
Toggle single multi pane:
    If app state is write, do not allow multiple mode.

Write pane:
    Communicate errors to user: no device, no tag, bad input
    Validate input before writing
    
Read pane:    
    If detect multiple tags in single mode, throw error.
TagActor:
    Move uid to parent?
    Move theft bit worker to tag actor
TheftBitWorker:
    replace on/off enum with the new value
    delete the whole thing.

Settings pane:
    comboBoxKeyboardShortcut chooses the first match. you cannot progress past the first
        by pressing the same key again
    Validation is not triggered by mouse click out of text field. Fix this.
    Compiler warning
        Note: C:\Users\MichalG\Documents\NetBeansProjects\SkyRfidJavaApp\src\skyrfidjavaapp\SettingsPane.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
        Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
        Fix error: resetForm unchecked call to set(T)
    Show and hide buttons to guide user to proper operation. zB do not allow use config before saving. 
        Or save automatically? Cancel instead of delete new config?
AppConstants:
    
AppSettingsEnum:
    delete. string constants suffice.

DataValidation:
    Check length in the reg ex pattern.    

Config names xml and dtd:
    delete
RoboTypist:
    recognize escape chars like \n \l
dll functions
    does stay quiet state persist after tag leaves field?
    how does multi read work? 
=======
Sending keystrokes via Robot. Notify user if platform does not allow robot constructor or input control.
	Catch errors related to existence of user32.dll.
	Customize extra keystrokes according to the active window.
Make jQuery for XML.    

Test barcodes that contain letters
