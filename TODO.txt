All panes:    
    Delete FxMsgBox class

App title:
    Concatenate app title with name of current configuration 


AppState:
    Why do I use ISO-8859-1 encoding of xml instead of utf-8?
    Add functions for new state elements
    Is it good practice to exit application in case of error in constructor?
    getConfig what if input string is null?
    Constructor: move error messages to constants
    Remove all getters and setters, make getSettingsValue and setSettingsValue public? 
        The advantage of the individual accessors is that one knows when one has covered 
        all of the parameters by cycling through all the functions. This makes writing code
        more reliable. See for example SettingsPane btnSaveConfig_Click.
        
Toggle single multi pane:
    If app state is write, do not allow multiple mode.

Write pane:
    Communicate errors to user: no device, no tag, bad input
    Validate input before writing
    Replace delayed reset with animation
    
Read pane:    
    If detect multiple tags in single mode, throw error.
    Bug when USB device is pulled out. Timer continues to run. Desired behavior:
        Stop the timer. Show message box. Instruct user to replace the device
        and reset the app from the File menu.
        How do you differentiate absence of tag from absence of device?
    Implement stay quiet.
    
TagActor:
    Move uid to parent?
    
TheftBitWorker:    
    delete. function has been moved to TagActor.

Settings pane:    
    Show and hide buttons to guide user to proper operation. zB do not allow use config before saving. 
        Or save automatically? Cancel instead of delete new config?
    Use extra keystrokes element. Send extra keystrokes with barcode. Allow
	multiple entries, such as one KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program x is the active window,
	two KeyEvent.VK_ENTER when program y is the active window.
    Adjust padding of panes for better fit
    Mnemonics for Save, Use, Close conflict with combo box keyboard shortcuts. Disable mnemonics (which work 
        in conjunction with alt). Replace with accelerators? Accelerators are attached to the scene. The scene
        is not available at the time the settings pane is initialized, which is when I would like to assign
        the accelerator. For now, omit accelerators and mnemonics.
    New config. If a new config is chosen after an existing config has been loaded, the form keeps
        the settings from the existing config. The form must be cleared. resetForm() starts an infinite
        loop, since it changes the config name combo box. 
    Extra keys. Provide a combo box with choices taken from KeyMap renderings. "Add" button, label with result. 
	"Clear" button? These features are built into Cogimag library ControlledStringInputComponenent.

    

MenuBarPane:
    and buttons
    SO 24499500 recommends assigning accelerators as well as mnemonics. The mnemonics
    interfere with combo box keyboard shortcuts. You may set an accelerator for a MenuItem.
    Other controls do not accept accelerators directly. You must assign them to the scene. If you
    want accelerators, SO 12710468 recommends working with KeyCodeCombination SHORTCUT_DOWN for multi-
    platform support.

AppConstants:
    remove style strings. they have been exported to the cogimag library.

AppSettingsEnum:
    delete. string constants suffice.

DataValidation:
    Check length in the reg ex pattern.    

Config names xml and dtd:
    delete

RoboTypist:
    recognize escape chars like \n \l from extra keys
    send keys interferes with typing, clicks. This seems to be due to the delay. By
        shortening the delay from 100 to 10 ms, the typist finishes before the 
        next read cycle, giving the system time to respond to mouse & keyboard input.
    extend getKeycode to more chars !@#$%
    SO 14572270 suggests alternative to Robot. Fire KeyEvent

dll functions
    does stay quiet state persist after tag leaves field? rf.exe can call stay quiet 
        and reset to ready. when stay quiet tag leaves field and is 
        reintroduced, it is ready
    how does multi read work? 

Sending keystrokes via Robot. Notify user if platform does not allow robot constructor or input control.
	Catch errors related to existence of user32.dll.
	Customize extra keystrokes according to the active window.
Make jQuery for XML.
Move FxMsgBox to MyJavaUtils package

Harmonize names app state, configuration, settings among file name, constant name, variable name

Test barcodes that contain letters
